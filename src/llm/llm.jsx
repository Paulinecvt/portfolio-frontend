        AI, LLM, what is it and why training them ?

        Over the past hundred years, we have witnessed an explosion of
        technological innovations that have profoundly transformed our daily
        lives. From washing machines to smartphones, and from the web to
        connected devices, these inventions have integrated so seamlessly into
        our lives that they have become indispensable. As sociologist Anthony
        Giddens pointed out, modernity is characterized by an “acceleration of
        technological change”, which redefines social interactions and reshapes
        economic and political structures. Today, artificial intelligence (AI)
        is at the forefront of this shift, with an impact as profound as that of
        past industrial revolutions.

            AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), have the ability to
            analyze vast amounts of data in seconds, providing instant
            responses. They can act as versatile experts, offering advice across
            numerous subjects, or as empathetic assistants responding to our
            everyday concerns. However, their effectiveness hinges on a crucial
            capability: understanding not just the content of our requests, but
            also the tone and context behind them.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            LLMs, as their name suggests, are trained on massive linguistic
            datasets to learn how to decode our questions and respond
            appropriately. But this learning process is far from autonomous.
            Behind these AI models are teams of specialists working tirelessly
            to refine their outputs. These experts establish strict rules, or
            guidelines, to ensure the models meet safety and reliability
            standards. For example, it’s vital that AI relies on scientifically
            validated sources and does not generate answers when lacking
            reliable information. Moreover, they must be able to detect
            malicious intent from users and avoid undesirable behaviors, such as
            disinformation or hate speech.

            The societal impact of these innovations is considerable. They
            reshape our relationship with knowledge and information, creating
            both opportunities for increased automation and challenges regarding
            ethics and safety. In this age of instant information, how AI models
            are trained and supervised becomes a critical issue to prevent
            potential risks and ensure responsible use of technology. Behind the
            scenes, experts ensure that these systems evolve within a secure
            framework, providing solutions that protect both users and society
            as a whole.

        <br/>
        <p>My native language, French, is not known for its inclusivity regarding gender. From our earliest 
            years of learning, it is common for the masculine form to take precedence over the 
            feminine in expression. Traditional French rules, such as proximity agreement and the 
            feminization of professions, have been challenged by the Académie Française over the 
            years. Today, in light of contemporary concerns, inclusive writing and the feminization 
            of professions spark debate in both the media and governmental bodies. Various groups 
            are organizing to explore ways to adapt our language to current usage without losing 
            complexity or adding reading difficulties for populations already faced with the many 
            rules governing our grammar. </p>
        <br/>
        <div className="flex flex-row justify-between text-justify">
            <div className="flex flex-col justify-end w-3/5 mr-6">
        <p className="flex flex-col justify-start text-justify">By learning English -US- and exploring its usage, I discovered the diversity of 
            pronouns and their importance for representing identities. By studying the work of 
            Howard S. Becker, it becomes clear that our use of language has profound implications 
            for the perception and representation of identities, particularly those related to gender. 
            The choice of words and labels we use shapes not only our understanding of individuals 
            but also influences how these individuals identify and interact with society, including 
            the technologies it offers. </p>
        <br/>
        <p className="flex flex-col justify-start text-justify"> This issue is all the more crucial in the age of artificial intelligence. As these systems 
            learn and adapt to our languages, it is imperative to ensure that they are trained with 
            inclusive and representative language to avoid perpetuating existing biases and 
            stereotypes in our society. By integrating inclusive linguistic practices, we have the 
            opportunity to shape artificial intelligences that meet the needs of a diverse population 
            and contribute to a more equitable and just society. This remains a challenge in French.</p>
        <br/>
        <p className="flex flex-col justify-start text-justify">Technological inclusivity allows a wide range of users to feel represented, encouraging 
            them to turn to language models to solve their problems. Without fearing judgment from 
            controversial sources that might question their identity or render them invisible, 
            French-speaking users also need an inclusive language adapted to the plurality of their 
            profiles, despite traditional grammar rules that can often be arbitrary.</p>

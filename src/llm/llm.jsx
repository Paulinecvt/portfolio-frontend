        Over the past hundred years, we have witnessed an explosion of
        technological innovations that have profoundly transformed our daily
        lives. From washing machines to smartphones, and from the web to
        connected devices, these inventions have integrated so seamlessly into
        our lives that they have become indispensable. As sociologist Anthony
        Giddens pointed out, modernity is characterized by an “acceleration of
        technological change”, which redefines social interactions and reshapes
        economic and political structures. Today, artificial intelligence (AI)
        is at the forefront of this shift, with an impact as profound as that of
        past industrial revolutions.

            AI, particularly large language models - LLMs, have the ability to
            analyze vast amounts of data in seconds, providing instant
            responses. They can act as versatile experts, offering advice across
            numerous subjects, or as empathetic assistants responding to our
            everyday concerns. However, their effectiveness hinges on a crucial
            capability: understanding not just the content of our requests, but
            also the tone and context behind them.

          <br />
          <p>
            LLMs, as their name suggests, are trained on massive linguistic
            datasets to learn how to decode our questions and respond
            appropriately. But this learning process is far from autonomous.
            Behind these AI models are teams of specialists working tirelessly
            to refine their outputs. These experts establish strict rules, or
            guidelines, to ensure the models meet safety and reliability
            standards. For example, it’s vital that AI relies on scientifically
            validated sources and does not generate answers when lacking
            reliable information. Moreover, they must be able to detect
            malicious intent from users and avoid undesirable behaviors, such as
            disinformation or hate speech.

            The societal impact of these innovations is considerable. They
            reshape our relationship with knowledge and information, creating
            both opportunities for increased automation and challenges regarding
            ethics and safety. In this age of instant information, how AI models
            are trained and supervised becomes a critical issue to prevent
            potential risks and ensure responsible use of technology. Behind the
            scenes, experts ensure that these systems evolve within a secure
            framework, providing solutions that protect both users and society
            as a whole.

          Diversity, inclusivity and translation challenges
        </h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          My native language, French, is not known for its inclusivity regarding
          gender. From our earliest years of learning, it is common for the
          masculine form to take precedence over the feminine in expression.
          Traditional French rules, such as proximity agreement and the
          feminization of professions, have been challenged by the Académie
          Française over the years. Today, in light of contemporary concerns,
          inclusive writing and the feminization of professions spark debate in
          both the media and governmental bodies. Various groups are organizing
          to explore ways to adapt our language to current usage without losing
          complexity or adding reading difficulties for populations already
          faced with the many rules governing our grammar.{" "}

              By learning English -US- and exploring its usage, I discovered the
              diversity of pronouns and their importance for representing
              identities. By studying the work of Howard S. Becker, it becomes
              clear that our use of language has profound implications for the
              perception and representation of identities, particularly those
              related to gender. The choice of words and labels we use shapes
              not only our understanding of individuals but also influences how
              these individuals identify and interact with society, including
              the technologies it offers.{" "}

            <p className="flex flex-col justify-start text-justify">
              {" "}
              This issue is all the more crucial in the age of artificial
              intelligence. As these systems learn and adapt to our languages,
              it is imperative to ensure that they are trained with inclusive
              and representative language to avoid perpetuating existing biases
              and stereotypes in our society. By integrating inclusive
              linguistic practices, we have the opportunity to shape artificial
              intelligences that meet the needs of a diverse population and
              contribute to a more equitable and just society. This remains a
              challenge in French.

            <p className="flex flex-col justify-start text-justify">
              Technological inclusivity allows a wide range of users to feel
              represented, encouraging them to turn to language models to solve
              their problems. Without fearing judgment from controversial
              sources that might question their identity or render them
              invisible, French-speaking users also need an inclusive language
              adapted to the plurality of their profiles, despite traditional
              grammar rules that can often be arbitrary.

          Training AI Responsibly: Avoiding Bias Through Inclusive Data
          Practices
        </h3>
        <br />
        <p className="flex flex-col justify-start text-justify">
          As an IA Trainer with an academic background in sociology, I have
          witnessed firsthand the profound impact that data can have on shaping
          technology—and, by extension, society. In the realm of artificial
          intelligence, the adage “garbage in, garbage out” could not be more
          relevant. If the data used to train AI models is biased,
          unrepresentative, or fails to consider cultural nuances, the resulting
          AI can perpetuate harmful stereotypes, exclusion, and disinformation.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="flex flex-col justify-start text-justify mb-4">
          A key aspect of responsible AI training is recognizing the diversity
          of users and adapting the AI to meet the needs of a wide array of
          cultures, genders, and identities. As sociologists like Howard S.
          Becker have demonstrated, the language we use and the frameworks we
          adopt influence how individuals perceive themselves and are perceived
          by society. This sociological understanding is critical when it comes
          to training AI, particularly language models, to ensure they generate
          responses that are not only accurate but inclusive and culturally
          sensitive.

              The Dangers of Poorly Trained AI
            </h3>
            <p className="flex flex-col justify-start text-justify">
              AI systems, especially large language models - LLMs, are only as
              good as the data they are trained on. A model trained on data from
              predominantly one demographic or with biased sources can produce
              answers that exclude or misrepresent other groups. Take, for
              example, early AI chatbots that were exposed to toxic internet
              environments, leading them to adopt harmful language patterns. In
              some cases, these models even produced biased responses when asked
              questions about gender or race, or made up “facts” based on
              unreliable information—a clear sign of insufficient fact-checking
              in their training process.{" "}
            </p>
            <p className="flex flex-col justify-start text-justify mb-4">
              {" "}
              One critical example of this is the use of biased prompts, which
              can lead to equally biased outputs. A poorly formulated prompt
              might ask, “Why are women less likely to succeed in
              tech?”—implicitly reinforcing a stereotype. Without proper
              training, an AI might respond with outdated or false information,
              failing to challenge the bias present in the question. A
              well-trained, culturally aware AI, however, should recognize the
              problematic nature of the prompt and guide the conversation toward
              more factual, unbiased insights.
            </p>
            <h3 className="subtitle uppercase text-left">
              Inclusivity in AI: A Cultural Imperative
            </h3>
            <p className="flex flex-col justify-start text-justify">
              Cultural nuances play a pivotal role in the effectiveness of AI
              responses. Language, context, and social norms vary across the
              world, and an AI system must be trained to navigate these
              differences. For example, while certain idioms or gender-neutral
              pronouns may be widely accepted in one country, they could be
              completely unfamiliar in another. If an AI is to serve users from
              diverse backgrounds, it must be equipped to recognize and respect
              these cultural variations.
            </p>
            <p className="flex flex-col justify-start text-justify mb-4">
              For instance, an AI developed for French speakers must consider
              the challenges of gendered language in French, where inclusivity
              is an ongoing debate. AI systems need to reflect these local
              conversations, promoting inclusivity and avoiding reinforcing
              outdated norms. Similarly, in cultures where multiple genders are
              recognized, AI must be capable of understanding and using
              appropriate pronouns to respect users’ identities.
            </p>
            <h3 className="subtitle uppercase text-left">
              Fact-Checking and the Internet’s Role
            </h3>
            <p className="flex flex-col justify-start text-justify">
              The internet is vast, unregulated, and full of misinformation. As
              AI models pull data from the web, the potential for inaccuracies
              increases if not properly managed. Fact-checking becomes a crucial
              component of responsible AI training. My academic background has
              equipped me with the skills necessary to rigorously evaluate
              sources, ensuring that the data I use to train AI systems is
              reliable and that the outputs are grounded in truth. This process
              is not just about weeding out falsehoods, but also about ensuring
              that AI does not inadvertently promote harmful content or suggest
              unsafe actions to users.
            </p>
            <p className="flex flex-col justify-start text-justify mb-4">
            For example, health-related queries can lead to serious harm if the AI delivers 
            inaccurate or unsafe advice. An AI that misguides users on proper medication 
            usage, or suggests hazardous home remedies, not only poses significant health 
            risks but also undermines user trust. This highlights the critical importance of 
            thorough fact-checking and the use of reliable, responsible data sources when 
            training AI systems—particularly those dealing with sensitive or life-impacting 
            areas. By ensuring that information is accurate and vetted, we reduce the risk 
            of harm and help create AI models that people can trust for their safety and 
            well-being.</p>

            In sum, responsible AI training goes beyond technical proficiency;

            sociological background, I bring this perspective to every project I
            work on. I recognize that AI has the potential to either perpetuate
            biases or challenge them—and it’s our responsibility to ensure we’re
            doing the latter. By incorporating diverse, accurate data and
            fostering inclusive practices, we can build AI systems that truly
            reflect the needs and values of a global population, providing safe,
            reliable, and respectful responses to all users.
